# Documentation 

This portfolio entry focuses on clean code principles and the use of Doxygen to generate documentation. I will briefly introduce a few key aspects of clean code principles and then apply them to refine the code I wrote in week 3. Next, I will generate project documentation using Doxygen. Finally, I will highlight examples from my code where I have eliminated the need for comments by adhering to the principles of clean code.

# Clean code

One of the most important aspects of software development is writing clean code. It promotes clear documentation and is crucial for ensuring others can understand our code.

### Clean code rules

A few key aspects of clean code are:


**Meaningful Names** - Consistently naming variables or functions is vital for readability. Effective naming enhances clarity and provides self-documenting code, making it easier to understand the code's purpose.

**Attention to Formatting** - Consistency in code formatting is essential for readability. Investing time in consistent formatting ensures that developers can easily locate specific sections of the code in the future.

**Comments** - While comments can be useful, they are often needed due to ambiguity or inconsistency in the code. By adhering to clear naming conventions for classes and methods and ensuring consistent formatting, the need for additional comments is reduced.

***DRY - Don't repeat yourself*** - Methods that frequently appear in the code performing the same function, or copied code snippets relocated to different parts of the project, can lead to potential errors. It's important not to replicate code needlessly.

***KISS - Keep it Simple, Stupid*** - Sticking to simplicity increases code clarity and eliminates the risk of error. Simpler code is not only more readable but also reduces the chance of errors.

***Single Responsibility Principle*** -  NEED TO ADD !!!!!!

### Clean code in practice

#### Original code

```
public class ContinentDatabase
{
    // SQLite connection for database acces
    private readonly SQLiteConnection db;

    // Path where the database file is located
    private readonly string databasePath;
    public const string DatabaseFilename = "ContinentDatabase.db3";

    public const SQLiteOpenFlags Flags =
        SQLiteOpenFlags.ReadWrite |
        SQLiteOpenFlags.Create |
        SQLiteOpenFlags.SharedCache;

    public ContinentDatabase(string DatabasePath)
    {
        databasePath = Path.Combine(DatabasePath, DatabaseFilename);
        Console.WriteLine("Initializing database connection...");
        db = new SQLiteConnection(databasePath, Flags);
        db.CreateTable<Continent>();
        Console.WriteLine("Continent table is set up.");
    }
```
#### Improved code

```
public class ContinentDatabase
{
    private readonly SQLiteConnection db;
    private readonly string _databasePath;
    public const string DatabaseFilename = "ContinentDatabase.db3";
    public const SQLiteOpenFlags Flags = SQLiteOpenFlags.ReadWrite | SQLiteOpenFlags.Create | SQLiteOpenFlags.SharedCache;

    public ContinentDatabase(string databasePath)
    {
        _databasePath = Path.Combine(databasePath, DatabaseFilename);

        Console.WriteLine("Initializing database connection...");
        db = new SQLiteConnection(_databasePath, Flags);

        CreateTable();
    }
    private void CreateTable()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Setting up Continent table...");
        db.CreateTable<Continent>();
    }
```

In the improved version of the code, I introduced a `CreateTable` method to encapsulate the table creation logic. This separates the responsibility of table creation from the primary task of the `ContinentDatabase`, which is to initialize the database. By doing this, I've adhered to the ***Single Responsibility Principle*** ensuring that each method has a single task. Additionally, the revised code is more self-descriptive, allowing for the removal of unnecessary comments.

# Doxygen

In this section, I will introduce examples of Doxygen, a tool that automatically generates documentation from source code. Doxygen can produce both online (in HTML) and offline (in LaTeX) documentation. Additionally, it can visualize the relationships between various elements through dependency graphs, inheritance diagrams, and collaboration diagrams. This tool is particularly beneficial for large organizations with extensive code bases, as it facilitates the creation of easy-to-read documentation.

Documentation is generated through comments in the code, formatted with XML-style tags. These tags are typically used in C# code comments and usually start with /// or /** ... */. Below are some examples of Doxygen comments and how they are generated as documentation.

```
/// <summary>
/// SQLite Database creating the table Continents,
/// with CRUD functionality.
/// </summary>
public class ContinentDatabase
{
    private readonly SQLiteConnection db;
    private readonly string _databasePath;
    /// <summary>
    /// Name of database
    /// </summary>
    public const string DatabaseFilename = "ContinentDatabase.db3";
    /// <summary>
    /// Database flags
    /// </summary>
    public const SQLiteOpenFlags Flags = SQLiteOpenFlags.ReadWrite | SQLiteOpenFlags.Create | SQLiteOpenFlags.SharedCache;
```

The ``<summary>`` tag provides a brief description of a class, method, or property. In the example above, the ``<summary>`` tag offers a concise description of the ``ContinentDatabase`` class, detailing its purpose and functionality. The subsequent tags describe the public variables ``DatabaseFilename`` and ``Flags``. Private fields ``db`` and ``_databasePath`` are without comments because, by default, Doxygen does not generate documentation for private fields, as they are not useful for external users.

<br>
<br>
<br>

```
    /// <summary>
    /// The ContinentDatabase contructor takes one parameter with database path,
    /// CreateTable() method creates Continent table
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="databasePath">the connection string to connect to the
    /// database holding the content of database path</param>
    public ContinentDatabase(string databasePath)
    {
        _databasePath = Path.Combine(databasePath, DatabaseFilename);

        Console.WriteLine("Initializing database connection...");
        db = new SQLiteConnection(_databasePath, Flags);

        CreateTable();
    }
```

The ``<summary>`` tag can also be combined with other tags. In the example above, the ``<summary>`` tag describes the ContinentDatabase constructor and its functionality. Additionally, the ``<param name="paramName">`` tag is used to document the ``databasePath`` parameter.

<br>

```
    /// <summary>
    /// The DeleteContinent method deletes a continents by its name
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="name">The name of the continent to delete.</param>
    /// <returns>Given continent deleted.</returns>
    public int DeleteContinent(string name)
    {
        return db.Delete<Continent>(name);
    }
```

In this example, the ``<summary>`` tag describes the ``DeleteContinent`` method and its functionality. The ``<param name="paramName">`` tag is used to document the ``continent`` parameter, while the ``<returns>`` tag provides documentation for the ``return`` value of the method.
