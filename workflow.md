# Workflow

This portfolio entry provides an overview of my understanding and application of workflow tools on GitHub. Specifically, it covers how I managed and executed tasks throughout their lifecycle:

* Accepting tasks from the project backlog
* Updating task information as required
* Progressing tasks on the task board
* Carrying out development on a feature branch
* Committing changes with meaningful comments
* Ensuring that work aligns with the Definition of Done (DoD)
* Creating pull requests

The specific issue tackled involved creating a local database using SQLite, implementing CRUD functionality, and ensuring its reliability through unit tests.
