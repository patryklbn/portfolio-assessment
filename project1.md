# Project work 1
This portfolio entry will demonstrate my ability to integrate the various dimensions of software engineering into practice that I have learned so far in this module. The next three portfolio entries will be based on the group project developing the UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) App.
An App is built in the .NET framework as the development environment, with C# as the main programming language, and cross-platform compatibility using the .NET Multi-platform App UI (MAUI) framework.
A team was provided a set of documented user stories and an entity relationship diagram, and the app would use an SQLite instance for all database operations.

In each weak my portfolio will include:
* A detailed summary of the issue I tackled.
* Snippets from my code, complemented by commentary illustrating my adherence to good software design practices.
* An explanatory overview of the test code I've written.
* A reflective analysis of the changes requested in the code reviews, along with the adjustments I've made.
* An insightful summary of any issues I've discovered while reviewing others' code.
* A reflective segment pinpointing specific learnings, challenges, or observations I've encountered along the way.
