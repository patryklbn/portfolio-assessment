# Project work 1
This portfolio entry will demonstrate my ability to integrate the various dimensions of software engineering into practice that I have learned so far in this module. The next three portfolio entries will be based on the group project developing the UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) App.   
An App is built in the .NET framework as the development environment, with C# as the main programming language, and cross-platform compatibility using the .NET Multi-platform App UI (MAUI) framework.
A team was provided a set of documented user stories and an entity relationship diagram, and the app would use an SQLite instance for all database operations.

In each weak my portfolio will include:
* A detailed summary of the issue I tackled.
* Snippets from my code, complemented by commentary illustrating my adherence to good software design practices.
* An explanatory overview of the test code I've written.
* A reflective analysis of the changes requested in the code reviews, along with the adjustments I've made.
* An insightful summary of any issues I've discovered while reviewing others' code.
* A reflective segment pinpointing specific learnings, challenges, or observations I've encountered along the way.

## Issue

All user stories were transferred to the GitHub issues on our team's repository and on our zube.io kanban board. Every team member was free to select the issue that they wanted to work on and assign it to themselves. The issue that I assigned to myself this week was:
<details><summary>As an UNDAC Deputy Team Leader I want to view a list of all local media agencies so that I can contact them immediately
</summary>

**End user goal:**
To be able to send out information as efficiently as possible

**End business goal:**
To ensure that the mission has an appropriate channel of communication to the local population

**Acceptance criteria:**

* Media agencies can be listed
* The list can be filtered by media type (e.g. 'press', 'radio', tv', etc.)
* List filters can be cleared
* Contact details for a particular agency can be readily viewed

</details>

In this task, I developed a feature for the UNDAC App allowing Deputy Team Leaders to swiftly access a list of local media agencies, crucial for outreach during missions. The functionality includes listing media agencies, filtering them by media type ("press", "radio", "tv"), clearing the filters, and providing a user-friendly display of contact details.
This feature is key to ensuring that vital information is promptly disseminated to the local population through the most effective channels.
