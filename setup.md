## SETUP

This portfolio entry details the correct setup of my development environment and potential alternative configuration settings 
using C# and Visual Studio (VS) to create a new MAUI app as part of group work.
The configuration began on a macOS system with Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 6 installed.

## Environment configuration
### Visual Studio 

The configuration process begins by updating Visual Studio to the latest version. I used the Visual Studio Update box to check for new updates by navigating to **Visual Studio > Check for Updates...**

<br>
Next, I configured the .NET MAUI App template. Before building, signing, and deploying .NET MAUI apps for iOS or macOS, I first needed the latest version of Xcode. Xcode is easily available on the App Store; simply search for "Xcode".

Finally, I downloaded and installed .NET MAUI apps using Visual Studio for Mac installer available on the Visual Studio website.

 ### Visual Studio and GitHub
 
Another step in the configuration was to clone the team's shared repository in Visual Studio and verify that the initial projects and configurations were functioning correctly. I opened Visual Studio, navigated to **File > Clone Repository...**, and entered the URL of the shared repository.

</figure>
<br>
<br>

After successfully cloning the team's shared repository, I built the project by right-clicking on the solution and selecting 'Build' (Fig. 5). I then ran the project to check if it was working by clicking the play button (Fig. 6).

### Kanban Board Setup with GitHub Integration

I volunteered to set up a Kanban Board with GitHub integration for my group project. I chose zube.io because it offers good integration with GitHub and reflects changes in real time on GitHub issues. Since we're working as a Scrum team, zube.io sprint management tools come in handy.

First, I went to zube.io and logged in with my GitHub account. Then, in the upper right corner, I clicked **Create a new organization**. Next, I entered our organization name and chose **Link a GitHub Organization**. Our group repository appeared since my account was already connected to my GitHub account (Fig.7). On the next page I entered our Project name  and **Create Project**(Fig.8)

</figure>
<br>
<br>
After creating a new organization and project, I created a test card and checked our group's GitHub repository to see if it appeared as an issue (Fig.9). Once I confirmed the successful integration of the zube.io kanban board with GitHub, I navigated to organization members on zube.io and invited all GitHub Collaborators via email (Fig.10).

#### Alternative to Zube.io
While **Jira** is a popular and robust project management tool widely used in the industry, its extensive features can be overwhelming for short-term projects and other team members without experience with the scrum framework. Zube.io, with its GitHub integration and simpler UI, offered our team a more immediate and seamless start.
 
## Reflection

### Limitations and possible improvements 
The configuration is appropriately set up for our project. However, it does have some limitations. Working as a team on a multi-platform app using different machines can introduce inconsistencies. Each team member needs to ensure regular updates and proper management of platform-specific SDKs, such as Xcode for iOS/macOS development. To eliminate the risk of inconsistency, using containersâ€”like Docker, for example, could be an effective solution.

### Difficulties and Resolutions
During the configuration, I encountered a difficulty. Since GitHub removed support for using passwords to authenticate Git operations this year, I had to generate a Personal Access Token (PAT). I did this by navigating to **Settings > Developer Settings > Personal access tokens** to authenticate during the cloning of a repository (Fig. 11). Once the token was generated, I removed the website password stored in the macOS keychain and replaced it with the newly generated token (Fig. 12).
