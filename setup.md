## SETUP

This portfolio entry details the correct set up of my development environment and potential alternative configuration settings 
using C# and Visual Studio (VS) to create a new MAUI app as part of group work.
The configuration began on a macOS system with Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 6 installed.

## Environment configuration
### Visual Studio 

The configuration process begins by updating Visual Studio to the latest version. I used the Visual Studio Update box to check for new updates by navigating to **Visual Studio > Check for Updates...**

<br>
Next, I configured the .NET MAUI App template. Before building, signing, and deploying .NET MAUI apps for iOS or macOS, I first needed the latest version of Xcode. Xcode is easily available on the App Store; simply search for "Xcode".

Finally, I downloaded and installed .NET MAUI apps using Visual Studio for Mac installer available on the Visual Studio website.

 ### Visual Studio and Github
 
Another step in the configuration was to clone the team's shared repository in Visual Studio and verify that the initial projects and configurations were functioning correctly. I opened Visual Studio, navigated to **File > Clone Repository...**, and entered the URL of the shared repository.

<br>
<br>

After successfully cloning the team's shared repository, I built the project by right-clicking on the solution and selecting 'Build' (Fig. 5). I then ran the project to check if it was working by clicking the play button (Fig. 6).

## Reflection

### Limitations and possible improvements 
The configuration is appropriately set up for our project. However, it does have some limitations. Working as a team on a multi-platform app using different machines can introduce inconsistencies. Each team member needs to ensure regular updates and proper management of platform-specific SDKs, such as Xcode for iOS/macOS development. To eliminate the risk of inconsistency, using containersâ€”like Docker, for example, could be an effective solution.

### Difficulties and Resolutions
During the configuration, I encountered a difficulty. Since GitHub removed support for using passwords to authenticate Git operations this year, I had to generate a Personal Access Token (PAT). I did this by navigating to **Settings > Developer Settings > Personal access tokens** to authenticate during the cloning of a repository (Fig. 7). Once the token was generated, I then removed the website password stored in the macOS keychain and replaced it with the newly generated token (Fig. 8).
