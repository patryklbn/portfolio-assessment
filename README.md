# Personal Portfolio of Group Work Documentation

This is my personal portfolio documenting the collaborative work undertaken with my group at Napier University, Edinburgh, as part of the Year 3 Software Engineering module. While the projects and activities were carried out as a group, this portfolio is a reflection of my contributions and perspectives within our collaborative framework. We operated using the Scrum methodology.

I update this portfolio weekly to chronicle my progress and experiences.
